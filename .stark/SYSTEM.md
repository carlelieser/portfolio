# STARK Problem-Solving Methodology

## Core Philosophy

### Three Axioms

1. **All problems are information problems** - What we call a "problem" is a gap between current state and desired state, revealed through information gathering
2. **Constraints reveal solutions** - Solutions emerge when we properly understand what we cannot change
3. **Simple systems succeed** - The simplest approach that addresses root causes will outperform complex solutions

### Mental Models

**First Principles Thinking**
- Break down problems to fundamental truths
- Question every assumption
- Rebuild from the ground up

**Inversion**
- Instead of "How do I succeed?", ask "How would I fail?"
- Define anti-goals as clearly as goals
- Work backwards from desired end state

**Occam's Razor**
- Prefer the simplest explanation
- Add complexity only when forced by evidence
- Each additional element must justify its existence

**Map vs Territory**
- Our models are not reality
- All frameworks (including STARK) are tools, not truth
- Stay empirical, test assumptions

**Second-Order Effects**
- Every solution creates new problems
- Consider consequences of consequences
- Think in systems, not events

## The STARK Framework

```
SITUATION → TARGET → APPROACH → RESOURCES → KNOWLEDGE
    ↓          ↓         ↓           ↓            ↓
  Where     Where      How        What         What
  am I?    going?   get there?  do I need?   did I learn?
    ↑          ↑         ↑           ↑            ↑
    └──────────┴─────────┴───────────┴────────────┘
                   ITERATE & REFINE
```

### Root Cause Analysis

**5 Whys Technique:**
1. State the problem
2. Ask "Why did this happen?" → Answer 1
3. Ask "Why did [Answer 1] happen?" → Answer 2
4. Continue 5 times minimum
5. Final answer reveals root cause

**Fishbone Diagram Categories:**

2. Minimal viable approach
3. Ideal unlimited resources approach
4. Contrarian/opposite approach
5. Technology-focused approach
6. Human-focused approach
7. Hybrid/creative combination
8. [Additional approaches...]

**Evaluation Dimensions:**
- Effectiveness (solves root cause?)
- Efficiency (resource usage)
- Risk (what could go wrong?)
- Reversibility (can we undo it?)
- Learning value (what do we gain?)
- Simplicity (implementation complexity)

### Evaluation Matrix

| Approach | Effectiveness | Efficiency | Risk | Reversibility | Learning | Simplicity | Total |
|----------|--------------|------------|------|---------------|----------|------------|-------|
| 1        | ?/10         | ?/10       | ?/10 | ?/10          | ?/10     | ?/10       | ?/60  |
| 2        | ?/10         | ?/10       | ?/10 | ?/10          | ?/10     | ?/10       | ?/60  |
| ...      | ...          | ...        | ...  | ...           | ...      | ...        | ...   |

**Selection Criteria:**
- Does it address root causes?
- Can we execute with available resources?
- What's the failure mode?
- How quickly do we get feedback?
- Does it create options or eliminate them?

### Pre-Mortem Exercise

**Assume the approach failed. Why?**
- What hidden assumptions were wrong?
- What dependencies broke?
- What did we overlook?
- What external factors intervened?

**Mitigation strategies:**

- Specific deliverables
- Owner assignment
- Time estimates
- Success criteria

**Level 3: Subtasks**
- Individual actions
- Granular steps
- Implementation details

**Dependencies:**
- What must finish before X can start?

## Phase 4: Resource Mobilization

### Resource Inventory

**Human Resources:**
- Skills available
- Time commitments
- Knowledge gaps
- External experts needed

**Technical Resources:**
- Tools and platforms
- Infrastructure
- Data sources
- APIs and integrations

**Financial Resources:**
- Budget available
- Cost estimates
- ROI expectations
- Funding sources

**Information Resources:**
- Documentation
- Prior art
- Research needed
- Domain expertise

**Time Resources:**
- Deadlines
- Milestones
- Dependencies
- Buffer allocation

### Resource Gap Analysis

**Current state:**
- What do we have?
- What's readily available?
- What's committed?

**Required state:**
- What do we need?
- When do we need it?
- What quality level?

**Gap closure:**
- Build vs buy vs borrow
- Priority order
- Acquisition timeline
- Fallback options

### Resource Acquisition Strategy

**For each gap:**
1. Can we work without it?
2. Can we substitute something else?
3. Can we build it ourselves?
4. Can we borrow/rent it?
5. Do we need to buy it?

**Prioritization:**
- Critical path items first
- High-impact, low-effort quick wins
- Long-lead-time items early
- Just-in-time for everything else

### Risk-Resource Mapping

**For each major risk:**
- What resources mitigate it?
- What's the cost/benefit?
- What's the timing?
- What's the backup plan?

**Resource constraints as risks:**
- What if we don't get resource X?
- What if resource Y is delayed?
- What if cost exceeds budget?

## Phase 5: Knowledge Integration

### Learning Loops

**During execution:**
- Daily: What did we learn today?
- Weekly: What patterns are emerging?
- Monthly: What assumptions need updating?

**Feedback cycles:**
- Build → Measure → Learn
- Hypothesis → Test → Evaluate
- Plan → Execute → Review

**Knowledge capture:**
- Decision logs (what, why, when, who)
- Learning logs (insights, surprises, changes)
- Issue logs (problems, solutions, prevention)

### Documentation Protocol

**As you go:**
- Log decisions with reasoning
- Capture context for future self
- Document the "why" not just "what"
- Record dead ends and failures

**Key documents:**
- SOLUTION.md: Problem analysis and approach
- PLAN.md: Detailed implementation plan
- Task reports: Individual execution records
- Post-mortems: Retrospective analyses

**Documentation principles:**
- Write for someone with no context
- Include date/time for all entries
- Link related documents
- Update when assumptions change

### Post-Mortem Framework

**What was supposed to happen?**
- Original plan
- Expected outcomes
- Assumed conditions

**What actually happened?**
- Actual results
- Deviations from plan
- Unexpected events

**Why the difference?**
- Root cause analysis
- Assumption failures
- Environmental changes

**What do we do differently?**
- Process improvements
- Updated frameworks
- New heuristics
- Better estimates

**What do we do the same?**
- What worked well?
- What should be standard practice?
- What gave us leverage?

## Cross-Cutting Principles

### Iteration Over Perfection

- Start with rough draft, refine over time
- Feedback loops beat extensive planning
- Ship → Learn → Improve
- Perfect is the enemy of done

### Leverage Over Effort

- Look for 80/20 opportunities
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Build reusable components
- Create systems, not one-offs

### Constraints Over Options

- Constraints force creativity
- Fewer options enable faster decisions
- Artificial constraints can help
- Embrace limitations

### Simplicity Bias

- Simplest solution that works
- Complexity requires justification
- Remove before adding
- Clear beats clever

## Problem Classification

### Clear Problems
- Known solution, known process
- Execute standard approach
- Focus on efficiency
- **Example:** Setting up a standard web server

### Complicated Problems
- Unknown solution, but knowable
- Expert knowledge helps
- Analysis and planning critical
- **Example:** Optimizing database performance

### Complex Problems
- Solution emerges through experimentation
- Probe → Sense → Respond
- Safe-to-fail experiments
- **Example:** Changing user behavior

### Chaotic Problems
- Immediate action required
- Act → Sense → Respond
- Stabilize first, analyze later
- **Example:** Production outage

### Confused Problems
- Not clear which type it is
- Gather information first
- Pattern matching
- **Example:** "Users aren't engaged" (vague)

**Apply appropriate framework:**
- Clear: Execute
- Complicated: Analyze → Plan → Execute
- Complex: Experiment → Learn → Adapt
- Chaotic: Act → Stabilize → Assess
- Confused: Clarify → Classify → Proceed

## Decision Frameworks

### OODA Loop
**Observe:** Gather current information
**Orient:** Analyze and synthesize
**Decide:** Select course of action
**Act:** Implement decision

Repeat continuously, especially in dynamic situations.

### Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions

**Type 1 (Irreversible):**
- Slow down, gather data
- Involve stakeholders
- Document reasoning
- Plan for consequences

**Type 2 (Reversible):**
- Move fast, decide quickly
- Learn by doing
- Easy to change later
- Don't overthink

### Expected Value Framework

For each option:
- List possible outcomes
- Estimate probability of each
- Estimate value (positive/negative) of each
- Calculate: EV = Σ (Probability × Value)
- Choose highest expected value

Account for:
- Upside potential
- Downside risk
- Uncertainty ranges
- Non-monetary value

### 10-10-10 Rule

**How will I feel about this decision:**
- In 10 minutes?
- In 10 months?
- In 10 years?

Surfaces:
- Short-term emotional reactions
- Medium-term practical impact
- Long-term strategic value

## Failure Mode Analysis

### Common Failure Patterns

**Wrong problem:**
- Solving symptoms not root cause
- Misunderstanding stakeholder needs
- Addressing yesterday's problem
- **Prevention:** Deep problem analysis, validate assumptions

**Wrong approach:**
- Using familiar tools for wrong job
- Over/under engineering
- Ignoring constraints
- **Prevention:** Generate multiple approaches, pre-mortem

**Wrong execution:**
- Poor communication
- Inadequate resources
- Skipping validation
- **Prevention:** Clear plans, regular check-ins, testing

**Wrong timing:**
- Too early (waste effort)
- Too late (missed opportunity)
- Wrong sequence
- **Prevention:** Dependency mapping, milestone tracking

### Recovery Protocols

**When stuck:**
1. Zoom out: What's the real goal?
2. Question assumptions: What if I'm wrong about X?
3. Seek fresh perspectives: Who else has solved this?
4. Simplify: What's the minimal approach?
5. Spike: Run small experiment to learn

**When failing:**
1. Stop digging: Pause current approach
2. Assess damage: What's broken, what's working?
3. Stabilize: Prevent further problems
4. Root cause: Why did this happen?
5. Adjust: Change approach or change target

**When successful (but stuck):**
- Local maximum problem
- Need to unlearn to relearn
- Consider: Is good enough actually good enough?

## Using This Framework

**This is a tool, not a religion.**

- Use what helps, skip what doesn't
- Adapt to your context
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Focus on thinking clearly, not filling templates
- The map is not the territory

**Start here:**
1. What's the problem? (One sentence)
2. What would success look like? (One sentence)
3. What's the simplest approach? (One paragraph)
4. What's the first task? (One action)

**Then expand as needed:**
- Add depth where uncertainty is high
- Add structure where coordination is needed
- Add process where learning is critical

**Remember:**
- Simple systems succeed
- Constraints reveal solutions
- All problems are information problems

Now go solve something.
